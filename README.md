# Flet Task Master
Hosted at: [https://flettaskmaster.publicvm.com/](https://flettaskmaster.publicvm.com/)
<br>

A cloud-powered, full-stack to-do list application built using Flet and Supabase, deployed on an AWS EC2 instance with robust security configurations and backend integrations.
<br><br>

## Features
- **Cloud-Based Storage:** All tasks are stored persistently with real-time updates and automatic synchronization.
- **Secure Deployment:** The application is hosted on a remote cloud instance with controlled access and strict security policies.
- **Credential Security:** No sensitive credentials are hardcodedâ€”secrets are dynamically retrieved from a secure storage system.
- **Priority-Based Task Management:** Users can assign and view task priorities (High, Medium, Low) with color-coded labels.
- **Automatic Task Sorting:** Tasks are sorted dynamically so that high-priority tasks appear at the top of the list.
- **Fully Responsive UI:** Optimized for both desktop and mobile devices, ensuring seamless usability across different screen sizes.
- **Persistent Uptime:** The app remains running even after SSH sessions are closed, ensuring uninterrupted availability.
- **Scalable Web Access:** A reverse proxy efficiently routes user requests, improving performance and scalability.
- **End-to-End Encryption:** All web traffic is secured with HTTPS, ensuring safe and encrypted communication.
- **Mobile Optimizations:** Editing a task automatically triggers the on-screen keyboard for a smoother mobile experience.
- **Error Handling & Stability:** The system gracefully handles network failures and database errors to prevent crashes.
