### 2️⃣ UI Enhancements

✅ Styled and structured the UI for better usability.

### 3️⃣ Task Functionality

### 5️⃣ Database Optimization

🔲 Prevent duplicate task entries (if user adds the same task multiple times).

🔲 Implement error handling to handle network issues or API failures.

### 6️⃣ Deployment

🔲 Deploy the Flet app to a web server so hiring managers can access it via a URL.

🔲 Choose a deployment service (Railway, Fly.io, Render, or a VPS).

🔲 Ensure Supabase credentials are stored securely in production.

### 7️⃣ UI Improvements & Features

🔲 Add an "Edit Task" feature (allow users to modify existing tasks).

🔲 Add categories or priorities (e.g., high/medium/low priority).

🔲 Improve visual styling to make the app more appealing.

### 8️⃣ Final Testing & Documentation

🔲 Thoroughly test all features before deployment.

🔲 Write clear documentation for setting up the project.

🔲 Record a demo video for portfolio.
